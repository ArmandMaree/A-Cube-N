	\section{Introduction}
	This project was project was proposed to the University by a company with the name of IMINSYS. The primary supervisor of this project is Morkel Theunissen.

	
	\section{Vision}
	The vision of this project is to create an application that extracts data from various existing systems such as Facebook, Gmail etc; the application will then construct a mind map of this data. The user will be able to navigate and expand the nodes known as "bubbles". The main nodes will expand to show posts, images, emails etc that you have marked as important, were tagged in etc. This information will be displayed in an interactive website. The mind map will have filtering capabilities and basic transformations which can be applied to the mind map.
