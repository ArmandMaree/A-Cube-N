	\section{Introduction} 
		\subsection{Purpose}
		\paragraph\indent
		This document provides details on the tests that were conducted on the system to increase stability, integity and scalability. The tests detailed in this document will be continuously updated as more tests are completed and more testing phases are entered.
		
		\paragraph\indent
		It is essential for this system to be developed in a test driven environment since a minor fault in one of the services could lead to large part of the system not functioning as expected. Thus fully automatic white-box testing will be applied as far as possible with the exception of a few manual tests. 
		
		\subsection{Test Environment}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Programming Languages}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Java
					\item Javascript
				\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Testing Frameworks}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{JUnit} will be used for testing the backend Java implementation.
					\item \emph{Dalek.js} will be used to test the frontend Javascript, HTML and CSS.
				\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Operating Systems}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{Linux} (more specifically \emph{CentOS}) is the operating system that is running on our servers that host all our services. It is thus essential that the all services function as expected on this operating system.
				\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Internet Browsers}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{PhantomJS and Google Chrome} will be tested during the automated unit tests conducted by \emph{Dalek.js}.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

			%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
			\subsubsection{Main Application Bean Test}\label{businessapplicationbeanstest}
				\paragraph{Objective} Make sure all the Spring beans are created and can be injected. This will at least indicate on a high level of grandularity that the Spring Framework did detect the bean declaration and can inject an appropriote object.
				\paragraph{Pass Criteria} All the beans set up with the \emph{\@Bean} annotation needs to have a non-null value when autowired (injected).
				\paragraph{Fail Criteria} Any of the beans have a null value.
		
			\subsubsection{FrontendListener Register Request Test 1}\label{businessfrontendlistenerregistertest1}
				\paragraph{Objective} Make sure the BusinessLogic service can receive a request to register a user who only chose one PIM source and send orders for other services to start some task.
				\paragraph{Input} A UserRegistrationIdentified object that contains all the neccesary information to register only a Gmail user.
				\paragraph{Output} A single UserIdentified object that will be retrieved from the RabbitMQ queue that leads to the database and a single AuthCode object that will be retrieved from the RabbitMQ queue that leads to the GmailPoller.

	\section{Additional Comments}
		\paragraph\indent
		All the objects that will be used in the input section of each test will be mocked in order to force certain criteria to be tested. Any RabbitMQ queues that lead out of the service that is being tested will have a dequeuer setup that only runs in the test environment.
		
		\paragraph\indent
		Also note that the pollers is not tested during the unit tests due to the need for them to receive authentication codes as it is outlined in the OAUTH2 protocol. In order to gain these authentication codes a manual sign in has to occur by a user. Large parts of these services will thus be tested during the integration tests.
		
	\section{Conclusion}
		\paragraph\indent
		All unit tests passed which is an idication that the application is ready to be deployed on the server.
