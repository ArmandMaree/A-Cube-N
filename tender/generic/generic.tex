			\paragraph{Interests and Hobbies}
			My interests include music, classic cars, cooking, traveling, breeding Shetland sheepdogs. My hobbies include reading, playing piano, camping, 4x4ing, tennis, training my dog, mountain biking and horse riding.
			
			\paragraph{Technical Skills}
			I am good at determining functional requirements of a system. I can place myself in the users shoes, this is valuable when determining how the user will intend to use a system. I can follow business logic easily and I have experience in databasing, Informatics, Statistics, Mathematics, multiple programming languages and Human Computer Interaction.
			
			\paragraph{Past Experience}
			I have built a fully functional, responsive website. I have helped a company modify their website. I have also observed (by job shadowing) the process of creating a system for a business and have noticed which qualities have caused them to excel and which have caused them to fail. I intend to use that knowledge to keep our team constantly progressing forward.
