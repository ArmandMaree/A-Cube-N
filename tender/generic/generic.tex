			\paragraph{Interests and Hobbies}
			My interests include playing and watching sport, specifically motorsport (Formula One, World Endurance Championship), cricket, tennis and golf. I play tennis twice a week at a club. I also like to listen to music and read books as well as play games on PC.

			\paragraph{Technical Skills}
			I'm more of a follower than a leader and I'm good at getting on with work once the tasks have been delegated to the members of the group. I enjoy working on tasks that interest me and don't mind working long hours to get it done, once I've put my mind to it. I have some experience in multiple programming languages and I enjoy learning new skills when I can. I also enjoy solving problems.

			\paragraph{Past Experience}
			Minor experience in Android Development.

			\paragraph{Interests and Hobbies}
			My interests include collecting music, long distance running, painting and drawing, reading, computer games and obviously spending most of my days programming. Not only do I want to program as a profession, it is also a hobby for me. Integrating my other hobbies into my programming is my passion.
			
			\paragraph{Technical Skills}
            I pride myself in always looking for new skills and for me, learning a new technical skill is the best part of the experience. I enjoy making my projects look visually pleasing and spend as much time making a working, functional program as I do making it look good. I have good logical and problem solving skills and enjoy problems presented to me in computer science. My technical skills stem from Mathematics and computer science, especially those skills from data structures and algorithms and programming logic.
			
			\paragraph{Past Experience}
            I have created static websites for companies before, my most recent one is (\href{http://bodytalkbethlehem.com/}{http://bodytalkbethlehem.com/}) and (\href{http://honeydewpools.co.nf/}{http://honeydewpools.co.nf/}).

			\paragraph{Interests and Hobbies}
			My interests include music, classic cars, cooking, traveling, breeding Shetland sheepdogs. My hobbies include reading, playing piano, camping, 4x4ing, tennis, training my dog, mountain biking and horse riding.
			
			\paragraph{Technical Skills}
			I am good at determining functional requirements of a system. I can place myself in the users shoes, this is valuable when determining how the user will intend to use a system. I can follow business logic easily and I have experience in databasing, Informatics, Statistics, Mathematics, multiple programming languages and Human Computer Interaction.
			
			\paragraph{Past Experience}
			I have built a fully functional, responsive website. I have helped a company modify their website. I have also observed (by job shadowing) the process of creating a system for a business and have noticed which qualities have caused them to excel and which have caused them to fail. I intend to use that knowledge to keep our team constantly progressing forward.
